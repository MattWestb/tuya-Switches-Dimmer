## Mounting in EU wall box with Siemens DELTA line frame
The Siemens DELTA line is one of the must used switch system in nothen europe and is easy to install and upgrading and with good quality (german) and flexibility.  
The largest problem is that the switches is very flat and squerich they is also building deep in the box and not leaving nore then around 10 mm behind that is to less for our switch / dimmer mudule.  
I have many 2 module with switches that is making it tricky putting in som other brands then i must shange both switches and the frame for getting all fitting  together and i dont like that then the designe of the Delta is great.  
And for the dimmer is needed resett (monometan) switches and the delta is not possible putting one spring inside so its going back that is possible with some other brands.  
  
Was doing looking little in shops and was finding 2 interesting swithes that can being used for dublle dimmer / sweitches then its have enugh space left for it in the wall box.
The first was made all of plastick and was not fitting with Siemens switches but was having lot of space bebind.
The second was Becker switches that is not building so deep but have the clams that is taking some space away but can being removed and only using normal scrues for mounting it and its one wersion with dubble reset that i need for the dimmer module.  
   
   
Switch:

Its gets 2 diferent formats of the Rockers and the S.1 is fitting to 95% in the Simend Delta frame the other is too largs so cant being used in my case.

Removing the 2 claws and screwes and cutting the plastick away so its enugh space for the module.![IMG_20210707_134646](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49618193/124778254-2154b580-df41-11eb-8c9a-4d6aa0892566.jpg)
Also taking some milimeters away from the Delta frame on eatch side so the plastich holder is fitting in the frame and holding it to the switch.

The module is fitting very well also with the DIN-rail monting but i removing it for getting little more space.  
Then only needing one small clamp for the 3 neutrale (smaller then easyer getting all inside without getting fire in the wall :-)) ).  
And easy putting together in one standard EU round box and with Simens Delta frames so not need changeing  all switches and outlets and keeping the disingn.

Right is 1 and have one dimmebal LED bulb. Left is 2 and is having one LED bulb that is not dimmebal but if working OK if not putting the dimming to low.  
  
Next up is putting it the wall box and removing the 2 crappy HOMA dimmers (chineese Zigbee 3 = HA1.X witth very bad range and routing) for my 6 GX53 under the kitchen kabenets and also moving them from the IKEA GW to ZHA with Billy EZSP but it must waiting until IKEA have fixing the firmware in the controllers.
