## Mounting in EU wall box with Siemens DELTA line frame
The Siemens DELTA line is one of the must used switch system in nothen europe and is easy to install and upgrading and with good quality (german) and flexibility.  
The largest problem is that the switches is very flat and squerich they is also building deep in the box and not leaving nore then around 10 mm behind that is to less for our switch / dimmer mudule.  
I have many 2 module with switches that is making it tricky putting in som other brands then i must shange both switches and the frame for getting all fitting  together and i dont like that then the designe of the Delta is great.  
And for the dimmer is needed resett (monometan) switches and the delta is not possible putting one spring inside so its going back that is possible with some other brands.  
  
Was doing looking little in shops and was finding 2 interesting swithes that can being used for dublle dimmer / sweitches then its have enugh space left for it in the wall box.
The first was made all of plastick and was not fitting with Siemens switches but was having lot of space bebind.
The second was Becker switches that is not building so deep but have the clams that is taking some space away but can being removed and only using normal scrues for mounting it and its one wersion with dubble reset that i need for the dimmer module.
