## Mounting in EU wall box with Siemens DELTA line frame
The Siemens DELTA line is one of the must used switch system in nothen europe and is easy to install and upgrading and with good quality (german) and flexibility.  
The largest problem is that the weitches is very flat and squerich they is also building deep in the box and not leaving nore then around 10 mm behind that is to less for our switch / dimmer mudule.  
I have many 2 module with switches that is making it  tricky putting in som other brans then i must shange both switches and the frame for getting all itting  together and i dont like that then the designe of the Delta is great.
